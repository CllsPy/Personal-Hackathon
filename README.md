# 🎉 **Start Here!**
This repository has two main objectives: 
1. **Help you master technologies** you have basic to intermediate knowledge of.
2. **Build an MVP** to demonstrate your learning.

## 💡 **Who is it for?**
This repository focuses on projects with **Artificial Intelligence** and is not intended for beginners in programming. It’s preferable to have basic knowledge of a programming language and some frameworks, such as: Python, pandas, Numpy, Streamlit.

The basic knowledge you have will be enough to start this journey. The most important skill is to find solutions online and break projects into small parts for gradual execution.

## 💡 **How to start?**
1. [`Fork`](https://github.com/CllsPy/Personal-Hackathon/fork) this repository.
2. Create another one with the name of the project you decided to work on.
3. Adapt the suggested projects to your reality, so the process is challenging but not stressful or anxiety-inducing.

## **Rules and Suggestions**
1. Conduct the project as independently as possible, resisting the temptation to look for ready-made answers.
2. Adjust the time chosen to your reality. I suggest a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48 hours.
3. During the project, maintain absolute focus, avoiding the use of social networks or mobile devices. Use the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes of focus followed by 5 minutes of rest).
